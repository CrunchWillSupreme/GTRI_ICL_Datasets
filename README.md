\f0\fs24 \cf0 # GTRI ICL Summary Analysis Datasets Repo\
This repo is meant as a placeholder for the datasets approved for data exploration and analysis for interviewing with the GTRI ICL team. Each folder represents a different dataset that can be selected to exploration and analysis. \
\
## Instructions \
Before attending the in-person interview, we at GTRI would like to give you the opportunity to show your best potential by completing a data exploration and analysis. This exercise is not meant as a brain teaser, there are no \'91gotcha\'92 instances within the data. We simply would like to get a glimpse of how you review, explore and summarize data. \
